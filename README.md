This is my personal website.
The website was built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). The site uses a theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). If you want to create a website simlar to this one, I highly recommend the Minimal Mistakes theme and the accompanying [guide](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).
I also found [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB) tutorial helpful for learning how jekyll works.
