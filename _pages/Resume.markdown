## H2 Project Experience

**Office Hours Backend,** School Project November 2019

-   I built a small web server for an Office Hours queue. The server
    read and wrote an HTTP subset on stdin and stdout. The finished
    project was a functioning web application accessible through a
    browser.

-   The backend was assigned as a project as a part of EECS 280:
    Programming and Introductory Data Structures. The instructors
    provided a python server and students were tasked with writing and
    implementing a linked list and REST api to take in and send out
    requests.

**Image Resizer,** School Project October 2019

-   I built an application that took an image and resized the aspect
    ratio without distorting the image.

-   The project was assigned as a part of EECS 280: Programming and
    Introductory Data Structures. As part of the project, I implemented
    a seam carving algorithm and utilized C style object-oriented
    programming.
